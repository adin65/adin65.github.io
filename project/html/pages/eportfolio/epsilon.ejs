                Our CSCC01 (Introduction to Software Engineering) course project was to build an application 
                that will assist entrepreneurs in preparing to start their own startup. It includes:
            </p>
            <div class="resume">
                <ul>
                    <li>a resource centre for users to learn how to pitch and legal document templates</li>
                    <li>a company profile set-up feature to allow users to advertise their startup</li>
                    <li>a job board so that entrepreneurs can recruit more talent</li>
                    <li>a marketplace for service providers such as accounting services and product
                        development services, which are partnered up with our stakeholder, to post their offers</li>
                </ul> 
            </div>
            <p>
                Given a list of requirements from our stakeholder, our team brainstormed and came up with user 
                stories that will cover most of the requirements. We also decided to use <b>Django</b> and <b>MySQL</b> for 
                the backend of our web application. Following scrum, we used Jira to create the user stories 
                tickets and used scrum poker to assign points to each story.
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-2"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-12">
            <div class="col-lg-2">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="col-lg-8" style="margin:1% 0">
                <p>
                    We had four sprints for the project. At the beginning of each sprint, we discussed the priorities 
                    of tickets under similar features and collectively decided a group of tickets that need to be done 
                    this sprint. Then, we each pick tickets that we would like to work on, and discuss the satisfaction 
                    criteria briefly. We used discord to hold frequent standups, where we share our progress on our tickets 
                    and bring up any challenges we were facing. All the team members were very great resources when it came 
                    to overcoming technical challenges. As we complete our ticket, we will create a pull request on GitHub and 
                    ask two of the team members to review the pull request before merging to the Develop branch. Towards the end 
                    of each sprint, the scrum master will organize the required documents for submission and ensure we are all 
                    set for our next sprint.

                <p>
                    For the first sprint, I worked on the backend for allowing the company admin or company owner 
                    to accept or decline a user wanting to join the company (which was then repurposed into viewing applicants’ 
                    profiles and inviting users to the company with a generated team code when the job application features were 
                    being developed).  In the second sprint, I worked on the frontend and backend for editing a user’s profile. 
                    On the next two sprints, I took the role of refactoring the backend into three-tiered architecture, which I 
                    learnt from my co-op experience with Softchoice and in lecture, and focused more on reviewing other team members’ 
                    pull requests. On the third sprint, we decided to focus the first half of the sprint on improving our front end 
                    appearance. As I worked on the team management page on the first sprint, I collaborated with Corey Fung to design 
                    and redo that page, as well as the repurpose on handling join company requests mentioned above.

                Towards the end, since I did more reviewing on other members’ code than developing myself, 
                I learnt a lot from their coding styles and had a strong map on where features are located 
                in the code and also which features compliments each other. We had quite a few merge conflicts 
                towards the end of the fourth sprint; as I looked over more than half of the branches, I was able 
                to notify my team members which part of the code was causing bugs due to the merge as we were testing 
                and we managed to fix all major bugs before the sprint ended. In addition to that, I made a step-by-step 
                instruction for our presenter to showcase most of the features implemented in the fourth sprint as one 
                job application process.

                We had two major roadblocks; we started slow on our first sprint as most of the members haven’t 
                used Django before. Even worse, we were advised by our course’s teaching assistant that Django 
                might not be suitable for our project during our demo! Shortly after the first demo, we made a big 
                decision to switch to using Flask instead and work a little harder to make up for the changes. 
                I wouldn’t know whether that was a good decision or not, but it definitely paid off well. Big thanks 
                to our TA for the advice!
                <br>

                Our second roadblock was when we started building the front end for the web application during 
                the end of sprint two; at first, we were planning on using React, but the application would not 
                understand any of the React syntax. With a bit of research, we realized we have been using Flask to 
                handle the routing of pages, so it wasn’t trivial to incorporate React into the project at all, so we 
                only used Bootstrap and CSS for styling.

                Despite all the challenges and having to do this course fully online, we all managed to pull through 
                (with a few all-nighters) and presented high quality work. I am really proud of this project.
