                Manually copying data from one table to another takes time. 
                Manually copying data from five tables in a workbook to another workbook daily or 
                all at once monthly is too tedious. To make this worse, the order of the columns 
                in the source changes and doesn't always matches the order of the columns in the destination.

                    Well, clearly what a <s>lazy</s> efficent Computer Science Student would do here is to 
                    find a way to automate it. So, after understanding the problem, I used the <b>macro recorder</b> 
                    feature in Excel to get started, and then edited the <b>Visual Basics for Application (VBA)</b> code produced by 
                    the recorder to have it work with a general case.

                    Since the files seems to be prepared manually, there are often typos and 
                    different names for the same column as well as worksheet 
                    (e.g., the worksheet YU can sometimes be called YUS). 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    However, the ordering of the columns is the same for the same number of columns, so at the beginning, 
                    the recorded macro only copies and pastes columns from one of its worksheet to the master file according 
                    to the number of columns in the source worksheet.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Throughout the process, I have been asking myself, how can I make this process easier for the user? 
                    What are the things I, as the user, find inconvenient? By asking these questions, I motivated myself 
                    to improve the code.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After using it for a while, I made more improvements so that it works more flexibly, such as copying and 
                    pasting data by column names and sheet names, while catching and handling cases where the names are not exactly the same. 
                    Whenever some data cannot be imported, the user will be informed, then such cases can either be handled manually or 
                    be added to a switch case statement to take care of such cases.
                </p>

                    </div>
                <p>
                    Also, instead of running it sheet by sheet, I slowly expanded it so that there is a UI for users to find the source files 
                    they wish to import with File Explorer and import them all at once.
                </p>

                Now, instead of spending a good 8 minutes per file to make sure everything is in 
                the proper worksheet and column, the person assigned to this chore can get it all 
                done in a minute or two, as long as there is no typo in a column.
