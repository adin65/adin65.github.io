      I'm a secondary school teacher specialized in teaching Mathematics and Python.
      With all the knowledge and experiences acquired throughout my life, including my studies at the University of Toronto Scarborough and two internships as a .NET Developer and a System Analyst,
       I am keen to turn on the light bulbs inside minds and light up the world, just like my teachers. 
      <br><br>

      After diving into Computer Science and learning programming languages such as 
      Python, Java, C and C#, I have used them to create better solutions to existing tasks. 
      I believe my passion in problem-solving as a developer would make the society I contribute to a better place. 
      <br><br>
      During my free time, I enjoy drawing. The tiny seagull on the bottom left of this page is one of my
      quick sketches. If you want to see more digital paintings made by me, feel free to click on the seagull.
